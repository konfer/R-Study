## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

require(base)

vector("numeric",5)

vector("complex",5)

seq.int(3,13,2)

pp <- c("Peter", "Piper", "picked", "a", "peck", "of", "pickled", "peppers")
seq_along(pp)

length(pp)
nchar(pp)

x <- 1:4
names(x) <- c("apple", "bananas", "kiwi fruit", "")
x

x <- (1:5) ^ 2
x

x[c(1,3,5)]
x[c(-2,-4)]
x[c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)]

names(x)=c("one", "four", "nine", "sixteen", "twenty five")
x[c("one","nine","twenty five")]

which(x>10)## 返回索引位置

which.max(x)
which.min(x)
