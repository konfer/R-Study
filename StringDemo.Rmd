## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

c(
  "You should use double quotes most of the time",
  'Single quotes are better for including"  inside     the string'
)

paste(c("red","yellow"),"lorry")
paste(c("red","yellow"),"lorry",sep="-") #连接后以”-“分开
paste(c("red","yellow"),"lorry",collapse = ",")#连接后以”-“连在一起

x <- (1:15)^2
toString(x)
toString(x,width = 40)

toString(x,width = 40)

x <- c(
"I", "saw", "a", "saw", "that", "could", "out",
"saw", "any", "other", "saw", "I", "ever", "saw"
)
y <- noquote(x)
x
y

pow <- 1:3
power_of_e <- exp(pow)
power_of_e
formatC(power_of_e)

heigths <- data.frame(
  height_cm=c(153, 181, 150, 172, 165, 149, 174, 169, 198, 163),
  gender=c(
    "female", "male", "female", "male", "male",
    "female", "female", "male", "male", "female"
     )
)
